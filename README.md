-Our team project is projected to be a movie database that will consist of two tables with a one to many relationship.
The first table will be a movie table with a title, director, year, genre, and description columns.
The second table will be an actor table with name, age, and gender columns

- The Movie Table would look like this
+Movie Id | Movie Title | Director | Year | Genre | Description
+---------+-------------+----------+------+-------+----------
+ 1 *Movie Title* |Director| Year |Genre| Description

- The Actor Table would look like this
+Actor Id | Actor Name | Age | Gender
+ ------------ | -------------
+ Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
+ Content in the first column | Content in the second column
